      Carolina Adapts Toys for Children
    </div>

    <div class = "catch-text">
      CATCH is a student-run organization at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill that <strong>"adapts" the circuitry of electronic toys for children with special needs.</strong> Toys are donated to hospitals and rehabilitation centers and any student is welcome to come and help!

        Putting Together My First Toys
      </div>

      <div class = "catch-text">
        My first CATCH meeting was at an event called "Late Night with Toys." This semesterly event brings together UNC students as a part of a four hours toy-adapting marathon.
      </div>

      <div class = "catch-text">
        After going through the orientation session, I partnered up and used a guide to configure my first toy. Over the next four hours, I worked with my partner to follow the guide to rewire a toy fire truck and redo some of our mistakes along the way. By the end of the four hours, I was exhausted -- <strong>but I was glad to see that I had finished rewiring my first toy. </strong>
      </div>

      <div class = "catch-text">
        Over the next few months, I attended weekly Tuesday meetings to continue learning how to take apart toys and rewire them for children with disabilities. Eventually, the whole process became second hand nature -- I would have to even reference the guide to attach and external button on a mew toy. I was able to start helping other groups troubleshoot their problems and understood how the wiring of the toys worked. Since then, <strong>I have finished and troubleshooted over 10 toys!</strong>

        Team Lead Training

      <div class = catch-text>
        Halfway through the school year, CATCH announced a new position -- Team Lead. Team Leads would need to <strong>devote additional time each week to undergo quality assurance training. </strong>Then, Team Leads would leads groups during regular meetings to ensure that the toys we were making as a club were <strong>achieving quality standards.</strong>
      </div>

      <div class = catch-text>
        We were instructed by a profesisonal with over 20 years of experience in soldering professionally. He taught us how to <strong>properly apply flux and solder to wire joints</strong> so that the conneciton was secure and would not be prone to breaking.

        Thrift Toys 
      </div>

      <div class = catch-text>
        Near the end of the year, CATCH received a donation of toys from a thrift store. They asked for volunteers to take apart these toys, figure out how they worked, and then configure them for children with disabilities. <strong>Looking for a challenge, I volunteered to take on this task.</strong>
      </div>

      <div class = catch-text>
        At first, I had trouble recognizing what wires I would have to cut and reconfigure in order to attach an external button. With the help of a mentor, I planned out what changes to make. Even though it took me longer to finish than the standard set of toys, I was happy that <strong>I had overcome the challenges I faced along the way.</strong>
