        Tyler's Iron Man Hand
      </div>

      <div class = "hhp-text">
        At the beginning of the year, we received a request to build a prosthetic hand for a child named Tyler -- he was outgrowing a previous design from North Carolina State University's Helping Hand Project club. Tyler had sent us photos of his hand measurement and a list of design parameters.

          Opening for his thumb
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class = "hhp-text">
        We decided to start with the open-sourced Phoenix v3 prosthetic hand design. This design uses a <strong>wrist actuation mechanism to grasp objects</strong> -- when Tyler bends his wrist inwards, the prothetic hand will close. 
      </div>

      <div class = "hhp-text">
        Below is an image of the Phoenix v3 design. In order to customize this design for Tyler's hand, we decided that we would need to <strong>scale the hand based on Tyler's measurements and create an opening for Tyler's thumb.</strong>
      </div>

      <div class = "phoenix-container">
        <img alt = "neevg-pta.github.io" src = "/photos/phoenix-v3-hand.jpeg" class = "phoenix-photo">
      </div>

      <div class = "hhp-text">
        After creating the first design using OnShape, we printed a couple of test hands. However, we noticed that even though the hand was scaled correctly, <strong>it would be hard for Tyler to insert his thumb in the current design.</strong> Widening the opening would sacrifice the structural integrity of the hand.
      </div>

      <div class = "hhp-cad-hand-photos">
        <img alt = "neevg-pta.github.io" src = "/photos/cad-hand-top.png" class = "cad-hand-photos">

      </div>

      <div class = "hhp-text">
        To remedy this problem, we decided to get rip of the bottom mesh layer and use straps to secure the design around Tyler's hand. We added <strong>moleskin </strong>on the interior of the prosthetic to <strong>protect Tyler's hand.</strong>
      </div>

      <div class = "hhp-text">
        We also saw <strong>an opportunity to add unique features to the design.</strong> We added a compartment that would allow Tyler to store spare parts, such as rubber bands, for his hand.
      </div>

      <div class = "hhp-text">
        The design work was finally done. It took us several tries to ensure that the pins in the hand were snug and that the dual-color extrusion on the 3D printers were able to produce Tyler's desired lettering. <strong>We assembled a care package by buying toys and signing a card for Tyler.</strong> After receiving approval for our parent organization, we shipped the hand.

      <div class = "hhp-text">
        A few weeks later, we received a message from Tyler -- <strong>he loved the new hand and the secret compartment that we had added!</strong> We were grateful to have the opportunity to work and learn with Tyler as he received his new hand.

        Joe's Guitar Finger
      </div>

      <div class = "hhp-text">
        Joe reached out to us with a unique project -- he was looking for a prosthetic finger to play the guitar. This was a new idea for all of us. In the past, we had only worked on standard hands for children who needed them. We decided to take on this project to challenge our engineering capabilities.
      </div>

      <div class = "hhp-text">
        Right off the bat, we knew there were lot of different factors that we knew we had to consider; <strong>The actuation needed to be quick and ergonomic while generating enough force</strong> to press down a guitar string. It would also need to be <strong>durable and adjustable</strong> to fit Joe's needs.
      </div>

      <div class = "hhp-text">
        We first considered how the trigger finger actuation. A couple of ideas we contemplated were bending the wrist or tapping the foot. However, both of these mechanisms had their own problems; wrist actuation would make it much uncomfortable to play while foot actuation would be logistically difficult to achieve. <strong>Instead, we decided to use elbow actuation.</strong> This would allow Joe to dip the guitar slighlty downward to actuate the trigger finger. 
      </div>

      <div class = "hhp-text">
        We started off by modifiying elbow actuation part of the open-sourced Unlimbited Arm (shown below).
      </div>
      

      <div class = "unlimbited-container">
        <img alt = "neevg-pta.github.io" src = "/photos/unlimbited-arm.jpg" class = "unlimbited-arm">
      </div>

      <div class = "hhp-text">
        Over several design interations, we <strong>increased the usability</strong> of the design by adjusting the finger position and removing excess material from the elbow actuation mechanism. We tested the actuation strength, changed the fingertip to a softer 3D printing material, and <strong>rerouted the string to make the trigger finger's force stronger.</strong> After making the prosthetic <strong>comfortable to wear</strong>, we decided to call Joe in to gauge our current design's feasibility.
      </div>

      <div class = "hhp-text">
        After fitting the prosthetic onto Joe's arm, we let him play around with his guitar. While the prosthetic initally gave Joe some trouble, he started to get the hang of it!
      </div>

      <div class = "hhp-text">
        Afterwards, we sat down with Joe to talk about needed changed to the design. First, we found that the <strong>finger actuation was still not strong enough</strong> to play notes consistently. In addition, <strong>the arm required a lot of fine-tuning</strong> -- which would be hard to do for Joe by himself. 
      </div>

      <div class = "hhp-text">
        Although we had learned a lot from working on this project, there is still a lot of work to be done to improve the design! <strong>We plan to continue developing the hand over the next year to present to Joe again.</strong>
